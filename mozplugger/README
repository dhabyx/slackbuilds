The goal of the mozplugger project is to provide a minimalist, clean,
 and stable general purpose Mozilla plugin module that allows the
user to embed and launch their favorite application to handle the 
various different types of media found on the Internet.

You may need to delete your local 
$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/xxx/pluginreg.dat 
file for mozplugger to be enabled correctly after you update it.
