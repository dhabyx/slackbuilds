Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3,
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists.
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also makes
a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie,
like frontend options, or restart X often.

Some optional and important dependencies, detected automatically:
* ffmpeg: is recommended for support a wide audio files variety
* libshout: this enables the shoutcast streaming output
* libmms: used for play mms:// and mmsh:// type network streams
* id3lib: add support for edit ID3 tags
* avahi: add support for discover services on network
* yajl: add support for open soundcloud.com streams

NOTE:  Be sure to edit the config file (/etc/mpd.conf  or ~/mpd.conf)
before running the daemon.
