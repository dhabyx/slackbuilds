Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, 
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. 
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that 
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also makes 
a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie, 
like frontend options, or restart X often.

Some optional dependencies include libshout, libmms, musepack-tools, 
lame, faac, faad2, ffmpeg, pulseaudio, fluidsynth, and jack.

NOTE:  Be sure to edit the config file (/etc/mpd.conf) before running 
the daemon.
