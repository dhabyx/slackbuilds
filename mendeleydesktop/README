Mendeley is software to organize, share, and discover research papers.
Like iTunes(tm) for research papers, Mendeley is a free research
management tool for desktop and web.

Before you use Mendeley, make sure that you agree with the terms and
conditions at http://www.mendeley.com/terms/

Optional Dependency

qt5 -- this is highly recommended (replacing Mendeley's bundled qt5) to
be able to access all the functions if you use KDE5.  You need to use
the option 'SYSTEM_QT5=yes', for example:

   SYSTEM_QT5=yes ./mendeleydesktop.SlackBuild
