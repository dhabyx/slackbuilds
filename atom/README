Atom is a Chorme-based text editor, hackable and full-featured.

Atom comes loaded with the features you've come to expect from
a modern text editor, like a file system browser, fuzzy finder for
quickly opening files, fast project-wide search and replace,
snippets, code folding and more.

To build Atom is necessary to download about 500MB of data, 
which are temporarily stored in /tmp/atom-cached-atom-shells
and ~/.atom, which can be deleted after building.
