electron-prebuild (Library for building cross-platform applications)

Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building
cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a
single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

This is electron binary repackaged in Slackware style.
